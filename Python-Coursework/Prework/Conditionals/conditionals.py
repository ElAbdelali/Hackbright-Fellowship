    # Give the logical opposites of these conditions:

    #     a > b

    #     a >= b

    #     a >= 18 and day == 3

    #     a >= 18 and day != 3

    # What do these expressions evaluate to?

    #     3 == 3

    #     3 != 3

    #     3 >= 4

    #     not (3 < 4)

# a <= b
# a < b
# a < 18 and day != 3
# a < 18 and day == 3

# 3 == 3 evaluates to True
# 3 != 3 evaluates to False
# 3 >= 4 evaluates to false 
# not (3 < 4) evaluates to false
